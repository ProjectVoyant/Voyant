# Voyant
Project Voyant aims to develop AI agents, or "Navigators," designed specifically to interact with the web in a human-like manner. These navigators would not just interpret data or provide information; they would physically interact with web interfaces, from clicking links to filling out forms or even engaging in online transactions.
